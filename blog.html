      <p>How it all started</p>
      <p>Are fitness buisness founded by Jaques Lemieux in 2001 was a place he wanted to help others acheive a healthy life.He wasnt in it for the money but to see the people around him suceed and develop everyday the came in to improve on themsleves. Although he has all his plans set out, sucess didnt come as quickly as he thought. After a couple months of setting everything up Mr.Lemieux was ready to open the doors to the public.</p>

      <p>Start of Sucess</p>
      <p>After a couple monthss of slow buisness and a couple of regular patients Jaques wasnt sure of where he would see this company in the future with the little attention he was getting. It wasnt till a little later that luck found Jaques on a quiet day. It was the weekend before the huge WWE event in Montreal and a couple of WWE members entered into the center. Jaques said "It was like these giants had entered to bless him." They said they needed a little training before there event and would help publisize his place if he helped them out. He agreed not knowing that his life would be changed forever. They would leave at the end of the day with jaques right behind going home. After the weekend he would come back expecting the same thing as usaul. This time it was different, a huge line had formed outside waiting for thr place to open. Word had gotten around that WWE stars were training there and many wanted to do the same. Jaues then knew this would be the start of something speacial.</p>
